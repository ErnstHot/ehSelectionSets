# ehSelectionSets

Save selections of objects and change attributes on all of them at once.

Avoid having to tediously select the same large set of objects more than once.

Stores selection sets with patcher.


It would have been nice to be able to re-select a selection set, but unfortunately it does not seem to be possible to select multiple objects with scripting.

See it in action here (sorry about the poor quality video): https://youtu.be/A3d95DPsbJg

IMPORTANT: Not all Max objects have a scripting name when you create them, but that is absolutely necessary for this to work, so give them names if they don't have them. If you create a series of objects, give the first one a scripting name and duplicate that object to create unique names for the rest.
It should work fine on the Max for Live UI objects though.
