# ehSelectionSets

Save selections of objects and change attributes on all of them at once.

Avoid having to tediously select the same large set of objects more than once.

Stores selection sets with patcher.


It would have been nice to be able to re-select a selection set, but unfortunately it does not seem to be possible to select multiple objects with scripting.
